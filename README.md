# phpintranet
The original Intranet I built in PHP

During my role as a systems administrator I was asked by the Financial Director to come up with a new intranet for the company.
I built this in PHP using some prior knowledge and tutorials online. This is connected to a mysql database managing multiple tables and sets of data.

Several pages on the intranet generate the data for DOM based on the data in the database tables. 

There are pages that use the google maps api to display where each of the company sites are in the country.

I built a several forms to manipulate the data in the databases on an admin page.

There was no requirement for a mobile friendly design or high security in regards to the databases as this was hosted on a local windows server and accessible only to 
employees computers within the organisation.
